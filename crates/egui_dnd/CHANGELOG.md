  the drag starts)
- Fixed bug where offset was wrong when the handle isn't the first element
- Allow the handle or buttons in the handle to be clicked
- Complete refactor, with much better state and detection handling
- Added `dnd` function that stores and reads the state from egui data, for simpler usage:

```rust
pub fn main() -> eframe::Result<()> {
  let mut items = vec!["alfred", "bernhard", "christian"];
  eframe::run_simple_native("DnD Simple Example", Default::default(), move |ctx, _frame| {
    CentralPanel::default().show(ctx, |ui| {
      dnd(ui, "dnd_example")
        .show_vec(&mut items, |ui, item, handle, state| {
          handle.ui(ui, |ui| {
            ui.label("drag");
          });
          ui.label(**item);
        });
    });
  })
}
```
