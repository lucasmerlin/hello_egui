/// A broadcast channel that can be used to send messages to multiple receivers.
/// Basically a mpmc version of [`crate::UiInbox`].

/// Internally, this is basically a Vec<`UiInboxSender`<T>>, so it's not optimized for crazy performance.
/// The goal is to provide a really convenient way to send broadcasts in egui (or other immediate mode GUIs).
///
/// NOTE: This is an unbounded channel, and each receivers queue is only emptied when it is read.
/// So if you don't read from a receiver, it might cause a memory leak. If you send a lot
/// of messages and only show a receiver's ui conditionally, it might make sense to read
/// the receiver in a separate update function. This is demonstrated in the `router_login` example.
